title: "Time as an important variable"

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
articles <- read_csv("data/master.csv")
```

This notebook focuses on time as an important variable.

# Does the mentions increase with the time since publication
```{r mentions with time}
articles_since_publication <- mutate(
  filter(articles, print_publication_date > "2013-01-01"), 
  days_since_publication = ymd("2018-07-13")-as_date(print_publication_date) 
)

ggplot(data = articles_since_publication) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = days_since_publication, y = total_mentions))


```

It turns out that the Scopus publication dates and Altmetric dates do not match. The Scopus data should all have been published from 1/1/13 but the Altmetric data shows a number of articles have been published before this date including 1965!
